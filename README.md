# Add-Up-To-A-Number

The purpose of this program is to have the user enter a number (n) and the output is the sum of all the numbers
from 1 to n

This number MUST be a positive number. If not, the user will be forced to input a positive number.

Ex:

Let n = 5

The output would be: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
